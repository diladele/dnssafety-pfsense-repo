# External repo for DNS Safety Filter for pfSense project

## How to create repo structure (only once)

The following steps assume you have FreeBSD 11 up and running. First, login into into console using normal user credentials (here we assume the user name is `builder`) and create the required folder structure.

	cd ~
    mkdir diladele
    cd diladele
    git clone git@github.com:diladele/dnssafety-pfsense-repo.git    

Now, retrieve the latest stable build of DNS Safety Filter into `dnssafety-pfsense-repo` folder.

    cd dnssafety-pfsense-repo
    fetch http://packages.diladele.com/dnssafety/0.4.0.9E0B/amd64/release/freebsd11/dnssafety-0.4.0-amd64.txz

And create the required repo structure using `pkg` command.

	pkg repo .

After this command the following files will appear in the current folder.

    digests.txz
    meta.txz
    packagesite.txz
    dnssafety-6.4.0-amd64.txz

Commit them into git and push to github.com.
